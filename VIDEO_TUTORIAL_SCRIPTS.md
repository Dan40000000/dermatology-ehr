**[Open new encounter]**

Open a new encounter for Sarah Johnson.

**[Click Start Scribe button]**

Click 'Start Scribe.'

**[Consent popup]**

Consent popup appears with legal text.

**[Read consent to patient]**

'Sarah, this visit will be recorded and transcribed by AI to help with documentation. The recording is encrypted and will be deleted after 30 days. Do you consent?'

**[Patient agrees]**

Patient: 'Yes, that's fine.'

**[Click Patient Consented]**

Click 'Patient Consented.'

**[Recording starts]**

Recording indicator appears. Red dot shows it's recording.

**[Conduct visit naturally]**

Now conduct the visit normally. Speak naturally - don't change your conversation style.

**[Example conversation]**

Dr: 'So Sarah, how's your acne been doing since our last visit?'

Patient: 'It was better at first, but now it's getting worse again, especially on my forehead.'

Dr: 'Are you still using the tretinoin cream every night?'

Patient: 'Yes, every night before bed, just like you said.'

Dr: 'Any other symptoms? Dryness, peeling?'

Patient: 'A little dryness on my cheeks, but not too bad.'

Dr: 'Good. Let me take a look... I can see you have about 15 to 20 papules and pustules on your forehead. The inflammation is moderate. The dryness on your cheeks is from the tretinoin, which is normal. I think we should add an oral antibiotic to help with the inflammation.'

Patient: 'Okay, what would I take?'

Dr: 'Doxycycline, 100mg twice a day. Have you taken antibiotics before? Any allergies?'

Patient: 'No allergies. I took amoxicillin once with no problems.'

Dr: 'Great. The main side effect is sun sensitivity, so use sunscreen and avoid prolonged sun exposure. You might have mild nausea - take it with food if that happens.'

Patient: 'Okay, for how long?'

Dr: 'Let's try 3 months and see how you respond. Come back in 6 weeks so I can check your progress.'

**[End visit]**

Visit complete.

**[Click Stop Scribe]**

**[Processing message]**

Let's review what the AI generated:

**SUBJECTIVE:**

Chief Complaint: 'Acne worsening on forehead'

HPI: 'Patient reports initial improvement with tretinoin cream, but acne now worsening on forehead. Compliant with nightly application. Experiencing mild dryness on cheeks. No other symptoms.'

**[Review draft - OBJECTIVE]**

**OBJECTIVE:**

Exam: 'Moderate inflammatory acne on forehead with 15-20 papules and pustules. Mild dryness on cheeks secondary to tretinoin. No cysts or nodules.'

**[Review draft - ASSESSMENT]**

**ASSESSMENT:**

'Moderate acne vulgaris, inadequate response to topical therapy alone.'

**[Review draft - PLAN]**

**PLAN:**

'Add doxycycline 100mg BID x 3 months. Continue tretinoin 0.05% cream nightly. Discussed side effects including photosensitivity and mild GI upset. Advised sun protection and taking medication with food. Return in 6 weeks for reassessment.'

**[Impressive! 90-95% accurate]**

Impressive! The AI captured 90-95% of the visit accurately.

**[Make minor edits]**

Make minor edits as needed - fix any errors or add missing details.

**[Example: Add allergy note]**

I'll add: 'Patient reports no known drug allergies.'

**[Accept draft]**

Click 'Accept Draft.'

**[Note sections populate]**

The AI content populates the note sections.

**[Add diagnosis code]**

Add diagnosis: L70.0 - Acne vulgaris.

**[Add prescription]**

Add prescription for doxycycline (the AI noted we discussed it, but doesn't create the actual Rx - you still do that).

**[Sign note]**

Review everything one more time, then sign.

**[Time saved]**

That took 30 seconds of documentation time instead of 5-10 minutes of typing. Huge time saver!

**[Privacy note]**

Important notes:
- Recording encrypted end-to-end
- Stored securely for 30 days
- Auto-deleted after 30 days
- HIPAA compliant
- Patient consent required every time

**[Best practices]**

- Always review AI draft carefully before signing

That's the Ambient AI Scribe - see patients, not your computer!"
