# Incident Response Tabletop Record

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Facilitator: Platform Security
- Scenario: Suspicious bulk access to patient records from privileged account

## Timeline Walkthrough

1. Alert triage and severity classification.
2. Immediate account containment and token/session revocation.
3. Evidence capture (audit trail, application logs, cloud control-plane logs).
4. Legal/compliance notification path and breach-assessment decision tree.
5. Customer and regulator notification checkpoints.

## Outcomes

- Runbook sequence validated for containment and forensics.
- Need explicit owner matrix for legal notification approval steps.
- Need quarterly tabletop cadence with documented completion evidence.
